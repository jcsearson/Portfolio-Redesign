Hey!  I am a front-end developer based out of Baltimore, MD.  With several years of knowledge in Electrical Engineering from Virginia Tech as well as Psychology from University of Maryland (Baltimore County), I have developed an extremely sturdy foundation upon which to excel.  I left school on my own accord when I realized that I wanted to pursure a career in this industry.

My skill-set includes HTML5, CSS3, Wordpress, a moderate amount of PHP, and a little bit of JavaScript and jQuery.  (And of course this is only the beggining of my web education.)  I am also a firm believer in maintaining strong communications, with coworkers and clients, as this is ultimately what will lead you to success.

As a person who has been able to take advantage of both educational institutions and online learning resources, I understand the value of keeping up with current trends.  As a result I often can be found reading blogs, books, listening to web podcasts, and learning everything I can take in from tech conferences.

When I am not coding, you can find me occasionally out with friends getting "fresh air", watching the English Premier League (my family originally is from England), working out,  or searching for new movies that I have not seen.
