Dr. Steven E. Caplan came to me with the task of redesigning the website for his Medical Practice.  This was an important task because the site is visited frequently by hundreds of concerned parents each day reaching out to receive medical care for their children.  The design needed to be clean and easy to follow as well as providing an asthetic appeal towards that of children.  The site was initially built on Weebly with a premade theme and was in dire need of switching to something more practical that adhered to the needs of his potential patients.
